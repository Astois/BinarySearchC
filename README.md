create an array of integers numlist

int num2dind

int low is index 0

int high is the last numberior jo-fjeow-f

isnumfound is false

while is numfound == false
  midnum = (low + high) /2

  if the num2find is the same as midnum
    print the array(midnum) and array position
    isnumfound = true

  if the num2find is smaller than the midnumber
    high = midnum - 1

  if the nun2find is bigger than the midnumber
    low = midnum + 1
